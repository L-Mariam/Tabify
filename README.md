# Tabify - Organize Your Browser Chaos
For browsers that look like they have ADHD.

Tabify transforms your browser tabs into a personalized, visual workspace:
* **Custom Tab Titles**: Rename any tab to whatever makes sense to you—"Do Now", "Client XYZ", or "THE Recipe"
* **Emoji Favicons**: Choose from curated emoji icons (⭐ ❤️ ⚡, etc.) or upload your own custom images
* **Toggle between session-only and persistent storage**: Choose between session-only changes (perfect for temporary organization) or persistent customizations that survive browser restarts
* **Save Presets**: Save your favorite title/favicon combinations for use across different tabs
* **One-Click Reset**: Always return to the original state with a single click

The extension works seamlessly across most websites, turning your browser into a personalized chaos that actually makes sense. Stop losing tabs in the void. Turn your chaos into _your_ chaos. Go try Tabify on the Chrome Store now.
